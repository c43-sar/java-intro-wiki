      <section>
        <h2>JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE (JVM)</h2>
        <p>
          A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a
          computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other
          languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed
          by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM
          implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of
          Java programs across different implementations so that program authors
          using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about
          idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform.<\p>
        </p>

        <p>
          The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial component of the Java
          Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). It plays
          a central role in the execution of Java programs.Here are key aspects
          of the Java Virtual Machine:
        </p>
        <h3>1.Platform Independence:</h3>
        <p>
          One of the primary goals of Java is platform independence. Java source
          code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode. The JVM
          then interprets and executes this bytecode on different platforms,
          allowing Java programs to run on any device that has a compatible JVM.
        </p>
        <h3>2.Execution of Bytecode:</h3>
        <p>
          Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. This
          bytecode is a set of instructions that the JVM can understand. The JVM
          executes these bytecode instructions, making it possible to run Java
          programs on any device with a JVM implementation.
        </p>
        <h3>3.Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:</h3>
        <p>
          The JVM uses a Just-In-Time compiler to translate bytecode into native
          machine code at runtime. This improves the performance of Java
          applications by allowing them to take advantage of the specific
          characteristics of the underlying hardware.
        </p>
        <h3>4.Memory Management:</h3>
        <p>
          The JVM is responsible for managing memory, including the allocation
          and deallocation of memory resources. It uses garbage collection to
          automatically reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer
          reachable or in use.
        </p>
        <h3>5.Security:</h3>
        <p>
          The JVM provides a secure environment for executing Java applications.
          It includes features like bytecode verification to ensure that code
          loaded into the JVM adheres to the Java language specifications. This
          helps prevent malicious code from causing harm.
        </p>
        <h3>6.Monitoring and Management:</h3>
        <p>
          The JVM provides tools and APIs for monitoring and managing the
          performance of Java applications. Tools like JConsole and VisualVM can
          be used to analyze memory usage, thread activity, and other aspects of
          program behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK)</h2>
        <p>
          The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit used for
          developing Java applications. It provides tools and libraries
          necessary for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications.
          The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is
          essential for running Java programs, and additional tools for
          compiling and debugging code. Here are the key components and features
          of the JDK:
        </p>

        <h3>Java Compiler (javac):</h3>

        <p>
          The Java compiler is a tool included in the JDK that translates Java
          source code (.java files) into bytecode (.class files), which can be
          executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The compiled bytecode is
          platform-independent, allowing it to run on any device with a
          compatible JVM.
        </p>

        <h3>Java Virtual Machine (JVM):</h3>
        <p>
          The JDK includes a JVM for running Java applications. The JVM is
          responsible for interpreting or compiling bytecode into native machine
          code and executing Java programs. It provides a runtime environment
          that supports features like memory management, garbage collection, and
          multithreading.
        </p>

        <h3>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</h3>
        <p>
          The JRE is a subset of the JDK and includes the JVM, libraries, and
          other components needed to run Java applications. While end-users
          typically only need the JRE to run Java programs, developers use the
          full JDK for software development.
        </p>

        <h3>Java API Libraries:</h3>
        <p>
          The JDK includes a vast set of standard Java API libraries that
          provide pre-built functionality for common tasks, such as working with
          data structures, networking, I/O, and user interfaces. These libraries
          simplify development and help ensure consistency across Java
          applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Development Tools:</h3>
        <p>
          The JDK includes various development tools to aid programmers in
          creating, debugging, and profiling Java applications. Some of these
          tools include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>javac:</h4>
            <p>Java compiler</p>

            <p>Java Stack Trace tool</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>JavaFX:</h3>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In earlier versions of the JDK, JavaFX, a platform for building rich
          internet applications, was included as part of the JDK. However,
          starting with Java 11, JavaFX is no longer bundled with the JDK but is
          available as a separate download.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Mission Control (JMC) and Java Flight Recorder (JFR):</h3>
        <p>
          These tools, introduced in later versions of the JDK, provide advanced
          monitoring, profiling, and diagnostics capabilities for Java
          applications. Java Mission Control allows developers to analyze the
          performance and behavior of Java applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Java Native Interface (JNI):</h3>
        <p>
          The JDK includes tools and libraries for integrating Java applications
          with native code written in languages like C and C++. JNI allows Java
          code to call functions written in native code and vice versa.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Development Kit (JDK) Releases:</h3>
        <p>
          The JDK is regularly updated with new features, improvements, and bug
          fixes. Developers can download and install different versions of the
          JDK to take advantage of the latest enhancements and ensure
          compatibility with their applications. When developing Java
          applications, developers typically use the JDK to write, compile, and
          test their code. Once the application is ready for deployment,
          end-users typically only need the JRE to run the compiled Java
          bytecode.
        </p>

        <h2>THE JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT (JRE)</h2>

        <p>
          The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools used for
          running Java applications. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
          class libraries, and other supporting files needed for the execution
          of Java programs. Unlike the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is
          geared towards Java application development, the JRE is designed for
          end-users who only need to run Java applications on their machines.
          Here are key components and features of the JRE:
        </p>

        <h3>Java Virtual Machine (JVM):</h3>
        <p>
          The JVM is an integral part of the JRE. It interprets or compiles Java
          bytecode into native machine code and executes Java applications. The
          JVM provides a runtime environment with features like memory
          management, garbage collection, and multithreading.
        </p>

        <h3>Class Libraries:</h3>
        <p>
          The JRE includes a set of class libraries that provide essential
          functionality to Java applications. These libraries contain pre-built
          classes and methods for common tasks, such as working with data
          structures, networking, I/O operations, and user interfaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Java Application Launcher (java):</h3>
        <p>
          The JRE includes the Java Application Launcher, which is used to
          launch and run Java applications. Users can execute Java applications
          by running Java bytecode files (typically with a .class extension)
          from the command line or by double-clicking on Java application JAR
          (Java Archive) files.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Plugin (Deprecated):</h3>
        <p>
          In older versions of the JRE, a Java browser plugin was included to
          enable the execution of Java applets within web browsers. However, due
          to security concerns and changes in web technology, most modern
          browsers no longer support Java applets, and the Java plugin has been
          deprecated.
        </p>
        <h3>Security Components:</h3>
        <p>
          The JRE includes security components to help protect users from
          potentially harmful Java applications. These components include the
          Java Security Manager, which enforces a set of security policies, and
          features like code signing, which allows developers to sign their Java
          applications to establish their authenticity.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Web Start (Deprecated):</h3>
        <p>
          Java Web Start was a technology included in the JRE that allowed users
          to launch Java applications directly from the web. Similar to the Java
          browser plugin, Java Web Start has been deprecated due to security
          concerns, and support for it has been removed from recent Java
          releases.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaFX (Optional):</h3>
        <p>
          In earlier versions of the JRE, JavaFX, a platform for building rich
          internet applications, was included. However, starting with Java 11,
          JavaFX is no longer bundled with the JRE but is available as a
          separate download.
        </p>
        <h3>Automatic Updates:</h3>
        <p>
          The JRE can include mechanisms for automatic updates, ensuring that
          users have the latest security patches and bug fixes. Users may
          configure their systems to receive updates automatically or manually
          check for updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          End-users typically install the JRE on their machines if they want to
          run Java applications but do not need the tools and components
          provided by the full JDK for development purposes. It provides a
          runtime environment that allows Java programs to be executed on a
          user's system in a platform-independent manner.
