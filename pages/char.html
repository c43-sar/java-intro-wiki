        <h1>Characteristics of Java</h1> <!-- Add a heading -->
        <p>Java is a programming language that has many characteristics that make it popular and powerful. Some of the main
          characteristics of Java are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Simple</b>: Java has a simple syntax that is easy to learn and understand. It removes many of the complex
            features of other languages, such as pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance. It also has an
            automatic garbage collection that frees the memory from unused objects.</li>
          <li><b>Object-oriented</b>: Java is based on the object-oriented programming paradigm, which organizes the data and
            behavior into reusable units called objects. Objects have properties and methods that define their state and
            behavior. Java supports the concepts of class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
          </li>
          <li><b>Platform-independent</b>: Java is platform-independent, which means that it can run on any system that has a
            Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is a software layer that interprets the Java bytecode, which is a
            platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler. This allows Java programs to be written once and run
            anywhere (WORA).</li>
          <li><b>Secure</b>: Java is secure, which means that it protects the data and code from unauthorized access and
            modification. Java has several security features, such as classloader, bytecode verifier, security manager, and
            sandbox. These features prevent the Java code from accessing the system resources or performing malicious actions.
          </li>
          <li><b>Robust</b>: Java is robust, which means that it is reliable and error-free. Java has several features that
            ensure the quality and stability of the code, such as strong data typing, exception handling, and automatic memory
            management. Java also checks the code for errors at compile-time and run-time.</li>
          <li><b>Architecture-neutral</b>: Java is architecture-neutral, which means that it is independent of the hardware and
            software architecture of the system. Java does not depend on the specific features of the processor, operating
            system, or network. Java programs can run on any system that supports the Java platform.</li>
          <li><b>Usage of JVM</b>: Java is first compiled into a intermediate <i>Byte Code</i>, which is then interpreted, which
            means that it is not directly executed by the processor, but by the JVM. The JVM translates the Java bytecode into
            the native machine code of the system at run-time. This allows Java programs to be dynamic and adaptable to the
            environment.</li>
          <li><b>High-performance</b>: Java is high-performance, which means that it is fast and efficient. Java has several
            features that enhance the performance of the code, such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, native method invocation,
            and multithreading. Java also optimizes the code for speed and memory usage.</li>
          <li><b>Multithreaded</b>: Java is multithreaded, which means that it can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. A
            thread is a unit of execution that has its own stack and program counter. Java supports the creation and management
            of multiple threads within a single process. This allows Java programs to be responsive and concurrent.</li>
          <li><b>Distributed</b>: Java is distributed, which means that it can run on multiple systems that are connected by a
            network. Java supports the development and deployment of distributed applications, such as web applications,
            client-server applications, and peer-to-peer applications. Java also provides various tools and frameworks for
            network programming, such as sockets, RMI, CORBA, and Jini.</li>
          <li><b>Dynamic</b>: Java is dynamic, which means that it can adapt to the changing environment and requirements. Java
            has several features that enable the code to be modified and updated at run-time, such as reflection, dynamic
            loading, dynamic linking, and dynamic code generation. Java also supports the integration of other languages and
            technologies, such as scripting languages, native libraries, and web services.</li>
        </ul>
