      <h1>4 Main OOPs Principles</h1>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
        organizes data and behavior into reusable units called objects. Objects
        have properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that define their
        state and behavior. The four main principles of OOP are:
      </p>
      <h2>Abstraction</h2>
      <p>
        Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and
        exposing only the essential features of an object. Abstraction helps to
        reduce complexity, increase reusability, and improve readability of
        code. For example, a car object can have properties like color, model,
        and speed, and methods like start, stop, and accelerate. The user of the
        car object does not need to know how the internal mechanisms of the car
        work, but only what the car can do and how to use it. Abstraction can be
        achieved in Java using abstract classes and interfaces.
      </p>
      <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
      <p>
        Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single
        unit and restricting access to them from outside. Encapsulation helps to
        protect the data from being modified or misused by other objects, and to
        enforce data integrity and consistency. For example, a bank account
        object can have properties like balance and interest rate, and methods
        like deposit, withdraw, and transfer. The balance property can be
        private, so that only the methods of the bank account object can access
        and modify it. Encapsulation can be achieved in Java using access
        modifiers like private, protected, and public.
      </p>
      <h2>Inheritance</h2>
      <p>
        Inheritance is the process of creating new classes from existing classes
        and inheriting their properties and methods. Inheritance helps to avoid
        code duplication, promote code reuse, and establish hierarchical
        relationships between classes. For example, a vehicle class can have
        properties like color, model, and speed, and methods like start, stop,
        and accelerate. A car class can inherit from the vehicle class and have
        additional properties like number of doors and seats, and methods like
        honk and park. A truck class can also inherit from the vehicle class and
        have additional properties like load capacity and trailer, and methods
        like load and unload. Inheritance can be achieved in Java using the
        extends keyword.
      </p>
      <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
      <p>
        Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take different forms and
        behave differently depending on the context. Polymorphism helps to
        achieve dynamic binding, flexibility, and extensibility of code. For
        example, a shape object can have a method called draw, which can be
        overridden by different subclasses like circle, square, and triangle.
        Each subclass can implement the draw method differently, according to
        its own shape. Polymorphism can be achieved in Java using method
        overriding and overloading.
